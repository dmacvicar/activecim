ActiveCim
---------

ActiveCim is a ActiveRecord/ActiveResource like API to get
data from a CIMOM server.

CIM properties are available with Ruby style so APropertyLikeThis
would be available as a_property_like_this.

What is implemented?

- defining classes
- find(:all)
- gathering properties

Requirements:

- The only implemented connector for now is a connector
  that uses wbemcli

Usage:

ports = Linux_EthernetPort.find(:all)

ports.each do |port|
 puts port.id
 port.device_id
 port.system_name
end

Plan (in more or less priority order):

- Implement selective find
- sblim native connector
- ws-man connector
- implement associations
- implement writing of properties
- implement calling methods

Mission:

ActiveCim effort has as a goal to access CIM data
from WebYaST.
