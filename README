ActiveCim
---------

ActiveCim is a ActiveRecord/ActiveResource like API to get
data from a CIMOM server.

CIM properties are available with Ruby style so APropertyLikeThis
would be available as a_property_like_this.

Features, What is implemented?

- defining classes
- find(:all)
- gathering properties
- more or less abstracted connector which allow to use
  any method to get the data (cim client, api, fake, etc)
  See Connector class documentation for information on
  what do you need to implement for a new connector

Requirements:

- The only implemented connector for now is a connector
  that uses wbemcli

Usage:

class Linux_EthernetPort < ActiveCim::Base
  self.site = "http://localhost/root/cimv2"
end

ports = Linux_EthernetPort.find(:all)

ports.each do |port|
 puts port.id
 port.device_id
 port.system_name
end

Plan (in more or less priority order):

- Implement selective find
- sblim native connector
- ws-man connector
- implement associations
- implement writing of properties
- implement calling methods

Mission:

ActiveCim effort has as a goal to access CIM data
from WebYaST.
